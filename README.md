## <a name="description"></a> Description 

Text Analyzer is an online text filtering tool that enables you to quickly filter and
edit text documents through an easy-to-understand user interface. This is done by
implementing different Regular Expression search functions under the hood, that
are accessed by simply typing in your search query in a text box and choosing
the different filters you want to apply. 

## <a name="how_it_works"></a> How it works

The web page can be broken into three parts:

1. Filter - the top of the page, where you chose if you want to remove or replace text. The user can chose to apply the filters on one word at a time or the whole text.
2. Text box - the middle of the page, where you type the text you want analyzed.
3. Counters - the bottom of the page, where the user can get quantitative information about the text.
