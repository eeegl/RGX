## <a name="description"></a> Description 

RGX is an online text filtering tool that enables you to quickly filter and
edit text documents through an easy-to-understand user interface. This is done by
implementing different Regular Expression search functions under the hood, that
are accessed by simply typing in your search query in a text box and choosing
the different filters you want to apply. 

## <a name="how_it_works"></a> How it works

The web page can be broken into three parts:

1. Input - the first textbox, where you enter the text you want to edit.
2. Filter - the middle of the page, where you apply the different filters.
3. Output - the second textbox, where the edited text is displayed.
